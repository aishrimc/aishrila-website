abstract: Observation of the redshifted 21-cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and Epoch
  of Reionization is a challenging endeavor in observational cosmology. Presence
  of orders of magnitude brighter astrophysical foregrounds and various
  instrumental systematics increases the complexity of these observations. This
  work presents an end-to-end pipeline dealing with synthetic interferometric
  data of sensitive radio observations. The mock sky model includes the
  redshifted 21-cm signal and astrophysical foregrounds. The effects of
  calibration error and position error in the extraction of the redshifted 21-cm
  power spectrum has been simulated. The effect of the errors in the image plane
  detection of the cosmological signal has also been studied. A comparative
  analysis for array configurations like the SKA1-Low, MWA, and HERA has been
  demonstrated. The calibration error tolerance of the arrays, under some
  assumptions about the nature of the systematic components, is optimally found
  to be  ∼0.01 per cent  for the detection of the signal. For position errors,
  an offset of ⪆5 arcsec makes the residual foregrounds obscure the target
  signal. These simulations also imply that the SKA-1 Low performs marginally
  better than the other telescopes in the image domain. The same is true for MWA
  in the power spectrum domain. This is one of the first studies that compares
  performance of various radio telescopes operating under similar observing
  conditions towards detecting the cosmological signal. This end-to-end pipeline
  can also be extended to study effects of chromatic primary beam, radio
  frequency inferences, foregrounds with spectral features, etc.
