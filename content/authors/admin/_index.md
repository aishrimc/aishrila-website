I am a Post Doctoral Research Associate at [Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester](https://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/). 

My present resarch is focused on HI Intensity Mapping. Neutral hydrogen (or HI) is an excellent probe to trace the structure formation and evolution of the Universe. I use data from radio telescope to map this HI from at early cosmic times to learn about the underlying processes that make large scale structures the way they are today.
